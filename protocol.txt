HBP (HexBombProtocol)

All messages are NULL-terminated.

Controllers can send the following commands to the server:

[ID],m,[DIR]
	tells the server to move in direction [DIR] (see below)
[ID],b
	tells the server to place a bomb

	afterwards, the server sends the location as coordinates [x],[y] of each player, identified by [ID]
	if a player is dead, [ID],d is sent
